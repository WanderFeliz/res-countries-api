## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - For types
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

Here I learned how to use in more detail the library Tanstack Query.


### Continued development

Something i want to keep improving is the use of TypeScript and Context Managers.

### Useful resources

- [Tanstack Query Docs](https://tanstack.com/query/v5/docs/react/overview) - This helped me in the use of react-query. Also going into the community is something i will recommend because there are some things that are explained in more detail.
